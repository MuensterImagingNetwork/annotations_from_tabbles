TODO  
* optional PATH if you move Image Files and want to change Annotations later on with new Tabbles Annotations
* Think about a correct matching algorithm for Images with multiple ImportFilePaths (ScanR)
* better output in the style of:
"deleted x Tags/KVPairs and added y Tags/KVPairs"
* if a Tag gets unlinked check if it is linked to something else and if not delete it
